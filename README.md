# Rotation Optimized Convolution and Parallel BSGS matrix-vector multiplication.       

This is the implementation of paper,     
Low-Latency Linear Transformations with Small Key Transmission for Private Neural Network on Homomorphic Encryption.      

We use lattigo v5.0.2 for implementation.            
https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo/tree/v5.0.2         

We provide several test function to reproduce the experiment.
